# YouTube MP3 Script
A script to download your favorite songs from YouTube in mp3 format.

## Installation
Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install "yt-dlp".
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```
Then you will need to install "ffmpeg".

### For Windows Users
You need to download the [latest build](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows).
After downloading the file, copy the files in bin folder and paste them into main Python's "Script" folder.

### For Linux Users
You can install ffmpeg just by using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## How to Use
First, create a text document in the same folder with script.
Text document's name should be:
```bash
music.txt
```
Then you can write music names that you want to download.
The resulting text file will look like this:

You can enter as many music names as you like.

Then run the "YTscript.exe", after it is done you will have a folder named Musics
which will include all the music files that you have named in your text file.
